## Architecture Updates

The project has been updated to follow domain-driven design principles with clear separation into:

- **Domain Layer:** Core business logic and entities
- **Service Layer:** Use cases that orchestrate domain objects
- **Core Layer:** Infrastructure services
- **Integration Layer:** Connections to external systems
- **User Interfaces:** Multiple interface options

## Current Focus: OpenAssetIO Integration

The OpenAssetIO integration has been enhanced with:

1. **Expanded Trait Support**
   - Added BifrostTraitHandler class for trait mapping
   - Implemented standard trait sets (basic, versioned, media, etc.)
   - Added support for nested trait properties
   - Created bidirectional mapping between asset attributes and traits

2. **Relationship Management**
   - Added support for asset relationships via the relationshipManagement trait
   - Implemented custom trait handlers for complex conversions
   - Created relationship discovery and export capabilities

3. **Validation and Discovery**
   - Added trait discovery from asset attributes
   - Implemented trait validation against required traits
   - Created utilities for working with standard trait sets

## Asset Domain Model

The Asset domain model has been designed with the following components:

1. **Entities**
   - Asset: Central entity representing a production asset
   - AssetVersion: Represents specific versions of an asset
   - AssetDependency: Represents relationships between assets
   - AssetType: Classification of assets

2. **Value Objects**
   - AssetIdentifier: Unique identifier for assets across systems

3. **Repositories**
   - AssetRepository: Interface for asset persistence
   - SQLiteAssetRepository: Implementation for SQLite (to be implemented)

4. **Services**
   - AssetService: Business logic for asset operations

5. **Domain Events**
   - AssetCreated, AssetUpdated, AssetDeleted
   - VersionAdded, DependencyAdded, StatusChanged

The domain model follows key principles:
- Rich behavior encapsulated in entities
- Value objects for immutable concepts
- Repository pattern for persistence abstraction
- Domain events for cross-boundary communication

## Implementation Notes

### OpenAssetIO Trait Handler

The `BifrostTraitHandler` class provides:

- Mapping between Bifrost asset attributes and OpenAssetIO traits
- Conversion of assets to traits data and vice versa
- Discovery of supported traits from asset attributes
- Validation of traits data against requirements
- Handling of complex relationship traits

Key functionality:
```python
# Convert asset to traits data
traits_data = trait_handler.asset_to_traits_data(asset, ["versioned"])

# Update asset from traits data
updated_asset = trait_handler.traits_data_to_asset(traits_data, asset)

# Discover supported traits
supported_traits = trait_handler.discover_traits(asset)

# Validate traits data
success, missing = trait_handler.validate_traits_data(
    traits_data, ["basic", "versionedContent"])
```

### Test Coverage

Unit tests have been created for the trait handler, covering:

- Expansion of standard trait sets
- Setting and getting nested trait values
- Discovery of traits from asset attributes
- Conversion between assets and traits data
- Handling of relationship traits
- Validation of traits data

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Trait Handler**
   - Finalize import of relationship traits
   - Add support for additional trait types
   - Implement caching for performance

2. **Integrate with Host Interface**
   - Update bifrost_host.py to use the new trait handler
   - Add batch operations for efficiency
   - Implement improved error handling

3. **Implement Asset Domain**
   - Create concrete implementation of Asset entity
   - Implement SQLiteAssetRepository
   - Create AssetService with business logic
   - Add domain event publishing

4. **Develop Folder Structure Domain**
   - Implement folder template system
   - Create path resolution algorithm
   - Add synchronization services
   - Integrate with Asset domain

5. **Initialize DevOps Implementation**
   - Create Dockerfiles for development and production
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow
   - Create initial Kubernetes configurations

## Development Timeline

The next phase of development should focus on:

1. **Weeks 1-2:** Complete OpenAssetIO trait handler integration
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Implement Asset domain model and repository
3. **Weeks 5-7:** Build folder structure management system
4. **Weeks 8-10:** Create workflow engine foundation
5. **Weeks 11-13:** Develop initial USD integration
6. **Weeks 14-15:** Set up CI/CD pipeline and deployment infrastructure

## Design Principles

Throughout the implementation, adhere to these design principles:

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Focus on the business domain, with rich domain models
2. **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, Open/closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion
3. **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns into layers with dependencies pointing inward
4. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing functionality
5. **CQRS Pattern**: Separate command (write) and query (read) operations
6. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use domain events for loose coupling
7. **Infrastructure as Code**: Define all infrastructure components as code

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests:** For all domain models, services, and utilities
2. **Integration Tests:** For repository implementations and cross-domain functionality
3. **End-to-End Tests:** For critical workflows like asset creation and publishing
4. **Performance Tests:** For operations on large datasets
5. **Infrastructure Tests:** For validating deployment configurations

All tests will be run in CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality.
