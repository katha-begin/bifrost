# Bifrost Development Log

This log tracks the progress of Bifrost development across multiple sessions, with references to milestones from the [development roadmap](docs/architecture/updated_development_milestones.md).

## Session 2025-04-03-1

### Summary
Updated architecture documentation and improved OpenAssetIO integration. Added support for published cache data in both asset and shot domains. Created detailed domain model specifications for the Asset domain. Added architecture and database diagrams for visual documentation. Created infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline documentation.

### Milestone Progress
- **Phase 1: Foundation** 
  - ‚úÖ Core System Design: Updated architecture to domain-driven design pattern
  - ‚úÖ Initial Storage Layer Implementation: Added cache data support
- **Phase 2: Domain Layer Implementation (Started)**
  - üîÑ Created Asset domain model specification
  - üîÑ Enhanced OpenAssetIO integration with improved trait handling

### Changes
1. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Created updated_overview.md with domain-driven design approach
   - Updated development milestones to reflect current progress
   - Added detailed implementation plan with timeline estimates

2. **OpenAssetIO Integration**
   - Created `traits.py` with BifrostTraitHandler for expanded trait support
   - Added support for standard trait sets and nested properties
   - Implemented bidirectional mapping between asset attributes and traits
   - Added test cases for the trait handler in test_traits.py

3. **Folder Structure & Cache Support**
   - Added PUBLISHED_CACHE DataType to support published caches
   - Updated StudioMapping class with asset_published_cache_path and shot_published_cache_path
   - Modified folder_service.py to properly handle published cache paths
   - Updated folder_mapping.yaml to include cache paths in published directory

4. **Architecture and Database Diagrams**
   - Created architecture diagram showing layered system design
   - Created database entity relationship diagram
   - Added diagram files to docs/diagrams directory
   - Included detailed explanations of both diagrams

5. **Domain Modeling**
   - Created detailed Asset domain model specification
   - Defined Asset, AssetVersion, AssetDependency, and AssetType entities
   - Designed repository and service interfaces
   - Added domain events and business rules

6. **Infrastructure and DevOps Documentation**
   - Created infrastructure diagram and deployment models
   - Designed CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
   - Developed container orchestration configuration for Kubernetes
   - Added detailed deployment and security considerations

### Decisions
1. **Domain-Driven Design Approach**
   - Decided to refactor the architecture to follow domain-driven design principles
   - Separated concerns into clear domain boundaries (Asset, Shot, Workflow domains)
   - Created rich domain models with behavior encapsulated in entities

2. **Published Cache Management**
   - Decided to store published caches within asset/shot version directories
   - Maintained separate cache paths for working/intermediate caches
   - Added fallback patterns for backward compatibility

3. **OpenAssetIO Integration Strategy**
   - Implemented a trait handler to abstract away OpenAssetIO complexities
   - Used bidirectional mapping for better maintenance and extensibility
   - Added standard trait sets to simplify common use cases

4. **Infrastructure and Deployment Strategy**
   - Decided on containerized deployment with Kubernetes
   - Implemented infrastructure as code for all environments
   - Designed CI/CD pipeline with multiple environments and thorough testing

### Issues and Challenges
1. Duplicate code for asset and shot cache handling in the get_path method needs refactoring
2. Need to ensure backward compatibility with existing folder structures
3. Need to implement concrete domain classes based on the specifications
4. Complexity of container orchestration requires careful resource planning

### Next Steps
1. **Milestone: Domain Layer Implementation**
   - Create concrete Asset domain model implementation
   - Develop SQLiteAssetRepository with transaction support
   - Implement AssetService with domain event publishing

2. **Milestone: OpenAssetIO Integration**
   - Complete the OpenAssetIO trait handler functionality
   - Integrate with existing bifrost_host.py and bifrost_manager.py
   - Add batch operations for improved performance

3. **Milestone: Folder Structure Management**
   - Implement the folder template system
   - Create path resolution algorithm
   - Add synchronization services

4. **Milestone: DevOps Implementation**
   - Create Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for development
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
   - Prepare Kubernetes manifests for staging deployment
