```

## Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables and Secrets
- Stored securely in GitHub Secrets or equivalent
- Different sets for development, staging, and production
- Rotation policy for sensitive credentials
- No hardcoded secrets in code or configuration files

### Infrastructure as Code
- All environments defined in Terraform
- Environment-specific variables stored in separate state files
- Modules for reusable components
- Remote state storage with locking

### Configuration Management
- Application configuration stored in environment variables
- Environment-specific configuration files
- Feature flags for phased rollout
- A/B testing capabilities

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
- Duplicate production environment
- Deploy to inactive environment
- Run tests and verification
- Switch traffic when ready
- Easy rollback by switching back

```
# Simplified procedure
1. Deploy version 2.0 to Green environment
2. Run tests on Green environment
3. Update load balancer to route to Green
4. Monitor for issues
5. If successful, Blue becomes standby for next release
6. If issues, switch back to Blue
```

### Canary Releases
- Release to a small percentage of users
- Monitor for issues
- Gradually increase percentage
- Roll back if problems detected

```
# Simplified procedure
1. Deploy version 2.0 alongside version 1.0
2. Route 5% of traffic to version 2.0
3. Monitor metrics and errors
4. If acceptable, increase to 20%, then 50%, then 100%
5. If issues, route traffic back to version 1.0
```

### Feature Flags
- Deploy code but keep features disabled
- Enable features selectively
- Target specific user groups
- Disable problematic features without deployment

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollbacks
- Triggered by failed smoke tests
- Triggered by error rate thresholds
- Reverts to last known good deployment
- Alerts team of failure

### Manual Rollbacks
- Emergency procedure for critical issues
- Accessible through deployment dashboard
- Requires appropriate authorization
- Logs reason for rollback

## Observability and Monitoring

### Pre-deployment Checks
- Service health checks
- Database migration readiness
- Storage availability
- Third-party service status

### Post-deployment Monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Performance metrics
- User experience metrics
- Business metrics
- Automated alerts for anomalies

## Security Practices

### Dependency Scanning
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Automatic updates for non-breaking patches
- Notifications for major vulnerabilities
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation

### Secret Management
- No secrets in version control
- Secrets injected at deployment time
- Regular rotation of credentials
- Principle of least privilege

### Compliance Checks
- Code scanning for compliance issues
- License compatibility verification
- Privacy regulation compliance
- Industry-specific requirements

## CI/CD Pipeline Metrics

### Pipeline Health
- Build success rate
- Average build time
- Test coverage
- Security findings

### Deployment Metrics
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes
- Change failure rate
- Mean time to recover

## Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

- Automated generation of API documentation
- Changelog from conventional commits
- Deployment runbooks
- Incident response playbooks
- Knowledge base for common issues

## Continuous Improvement

- Regular review of pipeline performance
- Post-mortem analysis of failures
- Feedback loop from production to development
- Periodic updates to tools and practices
